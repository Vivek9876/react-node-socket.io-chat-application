# Realtime Chat Application

### [Live Site](https://realtime-chat-application.netlify.com)

## Introduction
This is a code to understand the working of socket.io with node js and react js. 

I created  Realtime Chat Application.React on the front end, with NodeJS + Socket.io web socket library on the back end. 

By this you will have have a strong understanding of how to send and receive messages using web sockets and Socket.io to make any real-time application.


Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start``` for both client and server side to start the development server
